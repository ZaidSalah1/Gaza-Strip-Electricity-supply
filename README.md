# Gaza Strip Electricity Supply

The Gaza Strip Electricity Supply Prject is a project that implements a data strucutre using sorted Singly linked list.

For the past decade, the Gaza Strip has suffered from a chronic electricity deficit, which 
undermined already fragile living conditions. The situation has further deteriorated since April 
2017 in the context of disputes between the de facto authorities in Gaza and the West Bank-based 
Palestinian Authority. The ongoing power shortage has severely affected the availability of 
essential services, particularly health, water and sanitation services, and undermined Gazaâ€™s fragile 
economy, particularly the manufacturing and agriculture sectors.

## The following figure shows the overall data structure:

The data input for this project will be the electricity data obtained from OCHA in a csv file 
(Electricity.csv attached)(note: this file is a normal text file; you can open it using notepad). Each line 
in this file contains a daily electricity record (Date, Israeli_Lines_MWs, Gaza_Power_Plant_MWs, 
Egyptian_Lines_MWs, Total_daily_Supply_available_in_MWs, Overall_demand_in_MWs, 
Power_Cuts_hours_day_400mg, and Temp) separated by comma (,).
